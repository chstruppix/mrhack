**Your place for the best beginner-friendly notes on all-things-hacking!**

First things first, I do NOT own or intend-to endorse any tools, websites or companies talked about in everything in this repo. All registered tools and services listed in these notes belong to their respective owners. The information provided about such tools is COMPLETELY my viewpoint added to their real definitions. I have provided credits wherever possible in the file itself, however, for any unintended exceptions, you may email me on my public mail and I would do what need be. The content provided in this repo is dedicated to ethical and educational purposes, and I am NOT responsible if utilized otherwise.

These notes have been created with the help of information available online, such as from great-instructors like Heath Adams (https://www.linkedin.com/in/heathadams, https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCyberMentor), to whom I am truly grateful for providing such invaluable information in his easy-to-understand courses. I recommend taking his courses for an even in-depth research and explanation on ethical hacking. He is a great person and will always be my mentor, his courses explain everything just-as-it-is. I cannot credit and emphasize enough on how influential he has been on my journey till here (and perhaps my future). Please, please check out his social media platforms and courses if you are really interested in all that has been provided here.

**These notes provide best-value (and value as intended) when combined with his Practical Ethical Hacking courses and are originally meant to be used with the course https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course**

I hope this repo stands valuable to you, both practically and educatively, while staying ethical in scope and purpose.

**To access my notes, simply download and install a working version of CherryTree (language: English) based on your Operating System on https://www.giuspen.com/cherrytree/ 
After that, download the file 'mrhackk.ctb' provided in this repo and run it on CherryTree. Make changes as need-be BUT give proper credits upon usage (as required by the MIT License this repo carries).**

These notes cover in-brief the very basics of Kali Linux, tools used for reconnaissance, enumeration and exploitation on a wide variety of systems with basic vulnerabilities and exploitation on Active Directory and should act as notes for https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/practical-ethical-hacking-the-complete-course. 

I will try to keep the notes updated and constantly improved, and appreciate any help given in the process. For further information or queries, mail me on the public mail provided on my profile.

Stay safe.
